Personal notes
==============

2024-01-10: Started project
2024-01-15: Added CNN model
2024-01-20: Training works now
2024-02-01: Made backup before refactoring
2024-02-15: Refactoring didn't go well, keeping old files

File structure is a mess - need to clean up someday

train_final_REAL.py is the one to use (not train_final.py!)

Magic numbers in train_final_REAL.py:
- 0.1307 = MNIST mean
- 0.3081 = MNIST std
- 42 = random seed (the answer to everything)
